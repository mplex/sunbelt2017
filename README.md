### Workshop 6. Algebraic analysis and visualization of multiple, signed, two-mode networks with ‘multiplex’ & multigraph’

Dear Participants,

As the time is approaching to the Sunbelt Conference in Beijing, I would like to remind you a couple of things.

* The workshop will take place at the Beijing Continental Grand Hotel, room BICC 310 on Wednesday 31 May between 8:00 - 11:00 AM

* To take a full benefit of the workshop, bring your laptop with the R environment installed (http://www.r-project.org/).

* The current version of the ‘multiplex’ package is 2.6, and it is available at http://cran.r-project.org/package=multiplex

* The devel version of the ‘multigraph’ package is 0.60, and it is available at http://cran.r-project.org/package=multigraph

* I suggest you have also correctly installed in your computer the package ‘Rgraphviz’ (http://bioconductor.org) in order to have another visualization device.


If you have any questions do not hesitate in contact me.

See you on Wednesday,<br/>
Antonio
